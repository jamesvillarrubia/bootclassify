# bootclassify
Standard bootstrap LESS and SASS overrides adding significantly more class capabilities.  Developed for inclusion where CMS's are heavily template driven (EE or Drupal) or where end users can build HTML but not CSS.  With these additional classes, almost all structure and formatting can be done from within the template and not need specialized css.
